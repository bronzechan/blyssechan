  Kid learns through <strong>mirroring our behaviors</strong>. We totally realize how true it is. <br> 
  We read, she reads. We write, she writes. We work hard, she works hard. <br>
  And soon we realize she would do exactly what we do to love us back. <br>
  Picking up camera and shoot pictures for us. <br>
  Greetings every morning. <br>
  And one time she even put one knee down to talk to us <br>
  (come on! I just want to get close to your eye level). <br>
  We ensure she knows she is doing the right thing with a positive vibe.
